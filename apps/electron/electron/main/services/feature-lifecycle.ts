/**
 * Feature lifecycle (main process) — Track I, Gate 1 runtime side.
 *
 * Maps each runtime-toggleable feature to its start/stop actions and applies the
 * difference between two resolved feature states when the user changes the preset
 * or a flag at runtime. Features WITHOUT a `start` action here can only be enabled
 * by a restart (surfaced to the renderer as `pendingRestart` so it can show a
 * restart banner). Disabling always takes effect immediately (the IPC gate + the
 * renderer store react live), and a `stop` action, where present, halts the
 * feature's background work.
 *
 * All start/stop bodies use dynamic import so this module stays light and free of
 * circular imports (it is loaded from config-handlers).
