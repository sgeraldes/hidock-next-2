// mergeDuplicateMeetingOccurrences) binds a recording to the occurrence whose
// window actually matches its timestamp and never forces it onto a far anchor
// (proven by recording-occurrence-binding.test.ts). But rows written BEFORE that
// policy landed can still point a recording at a meeting weeks away — e.g. a
// July-1 recording bundled onto the May-27 anchor of a recurring series.
//
// This is a STALE-DATA repair, so it is GATED: findMisbundledRecordings() /
// repairMisbundledRecordings({confirm:false}) only REPORT (count + sample); the
// rewrite runs only with confirm:true. It re-points a misbundled recording onto
// the better-matching sibling occurrence of the SAME series (using the exact
// selectAutoLinkMeeting policy) or, when no sibling matches, unlinks it so it
// returns to the candidate pool — never leaving it on a window weeks away.
