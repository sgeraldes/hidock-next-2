/**
 * Feature gate (main process) — Track I, Gate 1 & Gate 2.

 * Reads the effective feature state from `config.features` through the pure
 * `resolveFeatureState()` resolver and enforces it:
 *
 *  - `isFeatureEnabled(id)` — background tasks + persistent loops consult this
 *    before starting (Gate 1).
 *  - `gatedHandle()` / `installFeatureGate()` — IPC channels owned by a disabled
 *    feature fail closed with a clear `FeatureDisabledError` (Gate 2).
 *
 * Fail-OPEN when features are unset (`config.features` missing): the default is
 * the `full` preset, so an uninitialised/mocked config behaves exactly as before
 * modular features existed (zero behavior change; existing tests keep passing).

 *    no NEW device/AI work starts; TEARDOWN/OBSERVATION channels (disconnect,
 *    cancel, reset, pipeline cleanup, passive status reads — `TEARDOWN_CHANNELS`
 *    in the registry) stay callable so in-flight / boot-active state can always
 *    be drained. Closing teardown too (round-1's `live && boot` on every

 *    leaving initiation open (round-2's boot-only gate) kept starting new
 *    device work the renderer said was off. The partition is the fix for both.
 *
 * `null` until `captureBootEffectiveFeatures()` runs at boot; the getter then
 * falls back to the live desired state so unit tests (and any path that never
 * boots) behave exactly as before — zero behavior change.
