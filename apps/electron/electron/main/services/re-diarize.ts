/**
 * Re-diarization service.
 *
 * The diarizer sometimes splits ONE person's voice across two speaker labels
 * (the owner's own voice gets a second "Speaker N"), or merges two people onto
 * one label. No amount of renaming fixes a bad segmentation — the SEGMENTATION
 * itself has to be redone. This service re-runs speaker segmentation for a
 * single recording on demand.
 *
 * Implementation (OPTION A — pragmatic, ship-now): Gemini couples transcription
 * and diarization in one pass, so "re-diarize" re-runs that pass with the
 * current (improved) diarization prompt and regenerates the speaker turns. It
 * reuses the existing transcription queue (same path as `recordings:reprocessWith`)
 * so it emits the normal `transcription:*` progress events for free, and the
 * completion path overwrites the transcript's `speakers` JSON in place
 * (`INSERT OR REPLACE` on `transcripts`). A true audio-only re-segmentation
 * (WhisperX + pyannote, from docs/experiments/diarization-spike.md) is a
 * documented follow-up — it needs a GPU + HF token + a Python worker subprocess
 * and is not readily runnable in-process, so it is deferred.
 *
 * Stale-name safety: fresh segmentation must NOT inherit the AUTO speaker names
 * the self-identification pass bound to the OLD labels (a new "Speaker 3" may be
 * a different person than the old "Speaker 3"). So before re-queueing we clear
 * the AUTOMATIC bindings and the self-id markers, while PRESERVING every MANUAL
 * correction the user made (per-turn overrides, speaker splits, and manual
 * label assignments). The transcription pipeline re-runs self-identification at
 * the end, so cleared auto names are regenerated fresh against the new turns.
 *
 * Idempotent: clearing is a no-op when there is nothing to clear, and the
 * operation is safe to run repeatedly.
 *
 * NO new tables and NO schema migration: it reads/deletes existing rows only.

 *
 * ADV46-1 (round-48) — ELIGIBILITY + ATOMICITY. Re-diarize feeds the
 * transcription/analysis AI pipeline, so an EXCLUDED recording (soft-deleted /
 * personal / value-excluded / hard-purged) must not be re-diarized or re-queued,
 * exactly like `transcribe`. This is NOT a deletion control — it is AI
 * re-processing that must respect exclusion. Two invariants, both enforced in ONE
 * synchronous transaction:
 *   1. Eligibility is asserted BEFORE any identity state is read or deleted, so a
 *      refused recording keeps its bindings / mentions / self-id markers intact.
 *      FAIL-CLOSED: {@link isRecordingEligible} returns false on any
 *      exclusion-lookup failure, so a transient DB error refuses rather than
 *      destroys identity data.
 *   2. clear → enqueue → status are ONE transaction: an EMPTY queue id or ANY
 *      enqueue/status failure throws, rolling the whole thing back (bindings
 *      restored, status unchanged) — never a partial identity deletion with
 *      nothing queued.
 * On refusal / failure this THROWS (the IPC handler maps it to an honest
 * `success:false`); it does not report success.
 *
 * Emits progress through the normal transcription queue events. Idempotent /
 * safe to run repeatedly.
