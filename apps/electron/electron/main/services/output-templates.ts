The header MUST use these exact values (do NOT invent dates or names — if a value is empty, omit that line):
**Meeting:** {meeting_subject}

### Discussion
[key points discussed]

### Decisions Made
[numbered list]

### Action Items
[who, what, when]

First, classify the call as one of: sales-to-delivery handoff, project/technical kickoff, engineering/working session, status/review call, demo, interview, 1:1, other.

Then write the handoff prompt with this structure (fill every section from the transcript; write "None mentioned" when truly absent):

# Follow-up: [short title of the call]

## Context
[2-4 sentences: what this call was, who participated (names/roles), what was decided at a high level. Written so an agent with zero prior context understands.]

## Call type: [classification]

## Objective for this session
[The single most valuable thing to produce next, based on the call type:
- sales-to-delivery → draft the Solution Design Document (SDD) / delivery plan
- kickoff → scaffold the project: repo structure, initial specs, backlog
- engineering session → implement or spec the discussed changes
- status/review → updated status report + remediation tasks for blockers
- demo → capture feedback into issues/backlog items
- interview → structured interview feedback document
State it as a direct instruction to the agent.]

## Facts and requirements from the call
[Bulleted, exhaustive: every technical detail, constraint, name, system, integration, deadline, budget/scope statement mentioned. Quote exact figures and names.]

## Decisions made
[Numbered list with who decided, if identifiable.]

## Action items
| Owner | Action | Due |
|-------|--------|-----|

## Open questions to resolve
[Things left ambiguous in the call that the agent should ask the user or flag.]

## Suggested first steps
[3-5 concrete steps the agent should take, in order.]

Output ONLY the handoff prompt in markdown. Do not add commentary before or after.
