/**
 * Identity signal hierarchy (design principle, Sebastián 2026-07-09):
 * "this is better and easier if there is a meeting related, with calendar, emails,
 * than if we rely completely on context."
 *
 * Prefer objective meeting/calendar/email evidence over transcript context, and
 * NEVER auto-link on LLM inference. The tiers below are the single source of truth
 * for how a mention-resolution's `method` string ranks — used to make the auto-split
 * sweep UPGRADE-ONLY (a higher-tier signal may overwrite a lower-tier resolution,
 * never the reverse) and to let a re-sweep upgrade resolutions when the M365
 * connector backfills real attendee emails.
 *
 *   TIER 1  connector-email     1.00   connector-confirmed identity (email match from a
 *                                      connector source: M365, Slack, Bamboo…)
 *   TIER 1b self-identification  0.97   a speaker states their OWN name in first person
 *                                      ("soy Ana", "les habla Pedro", "my name is Tom").
 *                                      Near-certain — a person naming themselves — so it
 *                                      sits just below a connector email and ABOVE any
 *                                      calendar/attendee signal.
 *   TIER 2  attendee-email      0.90   linked-meeting attendee, from CALENDAR data
 *                                      (meetings.attendees / organizer_email present)
 *   —       manual            (user) an explicit human pick in the "Resolve per
 *                                    meeting" UI. Sovereign: never auto-overwritten.
 *   TIER 3  speaker-map       0.85   a user-confirmed transcript speaker assignment
 *                                    (transcript_speakers)
 *   TIER 4  attendee-context  0.70   sole candidate among the meeting's people, but
 *                                    those people are TRANSCRIPT-derived, not calendar
 *                                    (the current reality until M365 lands — weak)
 *   TIER 5  lexical           0.60   full-name mention / co-presence in the transcript
 *   TIER 6  inferred          —      anything LLM-inferred. NEVER auto-links.
 *
 * CRITICAL (verified read-only on the live DB, 2026-07-09): 0 of 1,951 meetings carry
 * attendee JSON or organizer_email — the Outlook ICS feed strips them, so ALL current
 * meeting_contacts links are transcript-derived. That is why 'attendee-context' sits
 * at TIER 4 (weak) today and 'attendee-email' (TIER 2) only appears once a connector
 * backfills real attendees; a re-sweep then upgrades those recordings.
