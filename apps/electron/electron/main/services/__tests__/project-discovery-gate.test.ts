/**
 * F12 — project discovery gate policy (pure).

 * (positive name structure AND recurrence). No database, no resolver — just the
 * thresholds, so a tuning change has to state its intent here first.
 *
 * The fixtures are adversarial in BOTH directions, because an earlier cut of this
 * scorer was mis-calibrated both ways: anything with a single non-blocklisted
 * token cleared the create floor (so recurring noise like "budget" recreated the
 * spurious-project problem), while a raw <3-code-unit rule DROPPED "AI", "XR" and
 * 2-character CJK names outright instead of deferring them.
