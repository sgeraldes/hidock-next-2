/**
 * v42 re-key failure injection: a failed tombstone rewrite must NOT record v42.
 *
 * Adversarial re-review (HIGH): the transactional re-key rolled back on
 * failure but the catch swallowed the exception, so schema_version still
 * advanced to 42 and the rewrite never retried — a transient failure stranded
 * v41 keys permanently. Migration 42 now rethrows after logging; the engine
 * records a version only AFTER its migration returns, so a failed rewrite
 * leaves the DB at v41 and the next boot retries.
 *
 * Injection: a BEFORE DELETE trigger on project_discovery_rejections that
 * RAISE(ABORT)s — it makes the re-key's rewrite DELETE fail exactly like a
 * transient engine error, is persisted in the DB file across reopen, and can
 * be dropped to prove the retry then succeeds. Runs against the REAL engine.
