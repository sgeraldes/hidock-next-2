/**
 * Org Reconciler — recording pre-assignment consumption (v31).
 *
 * autoLinkRecordingsToMeetings normally links an unlinked recording to the
 * meeting it overlaps in time. A user pre-assignment (attribution chosen IN
 * ADVANCE while the device was recording) overrides that:
 *   - an explicit meeting_id wins over any time-overlap match
 *   - an explicit NULL forces the recording standalone (blocks auto-link)
 * In both cases the preassignment row is consumed (deleted) after it is applied.
 *
 * The DB module is mocked so the logic runs offline; queryAll branches on the SQL
 * text (recordings vs meetings) and `run` is a spy we assert against.
