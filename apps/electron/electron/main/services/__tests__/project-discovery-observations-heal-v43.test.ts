/**
 * v43 same-version shape hazard: healing a database stranded by the FIRST cut.
 *
 * `project_discovery_observations` shipped in one commit and gained its
 * meeting_id column in the next — both under schema version 43. A database that
 * reached v43 from the earlier build therefore has the table WITHOUT meeting_id
 * and will never run migration 43 again (the engine only runs migrations above
 * the recorded version), while `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op against an
 * existing table of the wrong shape. Every observation insert would fail and
 * discovery reconciliation would be silently dead for all new candidates.
 *
 * repairPhase runs on EVERY boot before migrations and force-adds the column, so
 * such a database heals in place. This test builds that exact state and proves
 * it, against the REAL engine.

  /**
   * Fail-closed proof. For an already-v43 DB migration 43 is SKIPPED, so
   * repairPhase is the ONLY heal path — if its repair fails and the failure is
   * swallowed, the boot continues with a schema that cannot accept an observation
   * write, recreating the stranded condition for the whole session and, under a
   * persistent failure, indefinitely.
   *
   * Four injections, each exercising a DIFFERENT way the schema can be unusable.
   * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op against any existing object, so none
   * of these self-heal:
   *
   *   VIEW            — PRAGMA table_info still reports columns, so the repair
   *                     sees a shape missing meeting_id and attempts the ALTER.
   *   INDEX           — SQLite shares a namespace across tables, views and
   *                     indexes, so CREATE TABLE fails with "there is already an
   *                     index named …" while PRAGMA table_info returns []. An
   *                     earlier cut gated its verification on PRAGMA returning
   *                     rows, so an EMPTY column list skipped the check entirely.
   *   MEETING_ID-ONLY — a real table carrying only the column the old check
   *                     looked for. ALTER can add score and the timestamps, but
   *                     name_norm/source_key/original_name are NOT NULL without a
   *                     constant default and cannot be added at all.
   *   NO COMPOSITE KEY— the subtlest: every column present, so column checks pass,
   *                     but ON CONFLICT(name_norm, source_key) has no constraint
   *                     to resolve against and every observation write throws at
   *                     runtime.
   *
   * All four must throw, and a later boot with the injection cleared must heal.
