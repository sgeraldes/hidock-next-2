/**
 * v41 → v42 upgrade path: NFKC re-key of discovery-rejection tombstones.
 *
 * Adversarial review (MEDIUM): v41 wrote project_discovery_rejections.name_norm
 * with the pre-NFKC normalizeName, so after v42 switched lookups to NFKC keys a
 * v41 tombstone recorded under a decomposed (NFD) or compatibility form no
 * longer matched — re-analysis would resurrect the dismissed project, and a
 * manual re-create could never clear the stranded key. Migration 42 must
 * transactionally re-key every existing rejection from original_name, resolving
 * NFKC collisions by keeping the NEWEST rejection per collided key.
 *
 * This test simulates the REAL upgrade: initialize, seed v41-style rows (keys
 * computed with the old non-NFKC normalization), roll schema_version back to
 * 41, close, and re-open — the engine then runs migration 42 against the same
 * on-disk database, exactly as a user's app would on update.
