/**
 * useDeviceConnection — the single source of truth for the device connect/
 * disconnect control shared by the titlebar status pill and the Device Sync page.
 *
 * Both surfaces MUST derive their status from the same store selectors and route
 * through the same connect/disconnect calls so their behavior can never drift.
 *
 * Status is derived from the app store (updated by OperationController from the
 * device service's connection/status listeners):
 *   - `connected`    → deviceState.connected is true
 *   - `connecting`   → a connect attempt is in flight (store step in-progress, or
 *                      this call site just kicked one off)
 *   - `disconnected` → otherwise
 *
 * ⛔ USB SAFETY (see CLAUDE.md): connecting is guarded by a MODULE-level in-flight
 * flag so two surfaces (titlebar + sync page) can never launch overlapping
 * connect attempts. One click = one attempt. We never auto-retry on failure.
