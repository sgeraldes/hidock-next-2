   * This is an EXPLICIT discriminator, replacing the old path-shape inference
   * (`hasDeviceFile || hasLocalPath`): `recordings.file_path` is NULLABLE, so a
   * real DB recording can legitimately surface as local-only with an empty
   * path — inferring "capture-only" from that misclassified it and stripped
   * its deletion/restore affordances (stranding it in Trash after a bulk
   * soft-delete). Optional for constructor-site compatibility; an absent value
   * means 'recording' (the fail-safe direction: a mis-stamped capture-only row
   * shows affordances whose IPCs fail honestly with "Recording not found",
   * whereas the inverse strands real user data).
